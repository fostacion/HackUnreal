# 🌐 Unreal World!

Welcome to **Unreal World** — a curated collection of web challenges designed to simulate real-world security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics of web security, or an experienced hacker honing your CTF skills, Unreal World offers a structured playground with escalating difficulty.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a self-hosted, modular web environment for practicing and demonstrating various web attack techniques, including but not limited to:

- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- SQL Injection
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Command Injection
- File Upload Bypass
- Web Logic Bugs
- Authentication/Authorization Flaws
- and more...

Each challenge is handcrafted with specific learning objectives and categorized by **difficulty level**:

| Level | Description                |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 🟢 Easy   | Fundamental concepts and common mistakes |
| 🟡 Medium | Realistic misconfigurations and subtle flaws |
| 🔴 Hard   | Complex chains, logic bypasses, and layered vulnerabilities |

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python / Flask / Django
- PHP
- Docker / Docker Compose
- NGINX / Apache
- MySQL / SQLite / Redis
- Burp Suite, sqlmap, ffuf (recommended for testing)

## 🧪 Why This Exists

Security is best learned by doing. Unreal World was built out of the belief that:

> *"To master web security, you must first break the web — and then understand how to fix it."*

This project helps CTF players, security engineers, and ethical hackers **simulate**, **exploit**, and most importantly, **learn** from vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started
